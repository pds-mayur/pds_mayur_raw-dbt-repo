## RCA summary
Failed to connect to Snowflake due to insufficient permissions for the specified role.

## Confidence score
0.9

## Validation
- Patch scope validated: **False**

### Recommended steps
- manual_review_required
- Review the suggested dbt/Jinja correction in remediation.md
- Confirm the variable/default value with the project owner
- Apply the SQL change manually after review
- Run dbt build --select affected_model

## Suggested correction for review

### Manual dbt/SQL remediation required
Target file: `models/run_level_failure.sql`

No SQL file was patched because the dbt error and available model context did not produce a confident corrected SQL patch. Review the dbt error and model SQL together, then apply only a correction that is confirmed by the project context.
