_Update models/staging/stg_customers.sql to use Snowflake column 'CUSTOMER_ID' for failed model 'stg_customers' (Snowflake type: NUMBER)._

```
with source_data as (
    select *
    from ECOMMERCE_DB.RAW.ORDERS
)

select
    order_id,
    CUSTOMER_ID,
    order_date,
    status
from source_data
```
